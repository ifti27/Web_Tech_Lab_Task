                    <h2>Automated Fan Depending on Temperature</h2>
                    <p>This project focuses on the development of an intelligent fan control system that automatically adjusts its speed based on 
                        the surrounding temperature to ensure energy efficiency and thermal comfort. It utilizes a temperature sensor to
                         continuously monitor the ambient temperature, while a microcontroller processes the sensor data and regulates 
                         the fan speed using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). The system automatically increases fan speed as the temperature 
                         rises and decreases it as the environment cools down. Additionally, real-time temperature readings and fan status 
                         are displayed on an LCD screen, providing clear and immediate feedback. This project demonstrates essential concepts 
                         of sensor interfacing, control logic design, and automation through microprocessor programming. Overall, it lays the 
                         foundation for smart home and energy-efficient systems by showcasing temperature-based automation and the effective 
                         integration of sensors and microcontrollers for real-time environmental control.</p>

                    <h2>Smart Parking Monitoring</h2>
                    <p>This project presents a Smart Parking System built using digital logic circuits to monitor and manage 
                        parking spaces efficiently. Developed for the Digital Logic Design course, it operates without 
                        microcontrollers or Arduino, relying instead on combinational and sequential circuits. IR sensors 
                        detect vehicle entry and exit, while up/down counters track parked vehicles and comparators 
                        determine available spaces. A 7-segment display shows real-time parking status, automatically 
                        updating as cars enter or leave. Fully hardware-based, the system demonstrates practical use of 
                        logic gates, counters, and sensors, showcasing the potential of digital automation for efficient 
                        parking management.</p>
